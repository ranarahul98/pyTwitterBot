# pyTwitterBot

pyTwitterBot is a program developed to delete tweets on an interval of time. This project was inspired by not having an application that will delete tweets for you without payment. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

You will need to install the python interface for the Twitter API.

```
pip install python-twitter
```

Next, you are going to create a Twitter app that is linked to the account you want to manipulate. The details of creating a Twitter app will not be covered here.

Once that is complete, take note of your application tokens and consumer keys

```
consumer_key=[consumer key],
consumer_secret=[consumer secret],
access_token_key=[access token],
access_token_secret=[access token secret])
```
